# Custom Capability sample

Shows the use of custom capabilities.

Note that the SCCD file included with this sample is not valid,
but it is included for instructional purposes.
If the PC is Developer Mode, the sample will deploy despite the invalid SCCD file.
When writing your own app, follow the instructions in
[Custom Capabilities for Universal Windows Platform apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/devapps/custom-capabilities-for-universal-windows-platform-apps)
to obtain a properly-signed SCCD file.

## Using a custom capability to connect to an NT service

The "Connect to an NT service" scenario uses a custom capability
to control access to an NT service.
For demonstration purposes, the service reads data from an imaginary device.

The scenario demonstrates the following:

- Declaring a custom capability "microsoft.hsaTestCustomCapability_q536wpkpf5cy2" in the manifest.
- Establishing an RPC connection to the NT service.
- Invoking methods over RPC to initiate data collection and alter the sampling period.
- Using an RPC callback to receive data from the imaginary device.

The service portion of this sample demonstrates the following:

- Converting the capability string to a SID using the `DeriveCapabilitySidsFromName` function.
- Using that SID to create the Security Descriptor for the RPC endpoint.

The following diagram summarizes the communication between the app and the NT service:

```sh                     
                  CLIENT                                   SERVER

```

Before you run this scenario, you must start the corresponding NT service.

* Build the NT service portion of the sample, which requires that the Windows SDK for Desktop C++ Apps be installed.
* Start the service from an elevated command prompt in one of two ways:
  * Install it as a service using `rpcserver.exe -install` and start it using `sc start hsaservice`.
  * Run the service in console mode: `rpcserver.exe -console`

## Using a custom capability to access a custom device

A series of scenarios demonstrate how to use a custom capability to access the
OSR USB FX-2 Learning Kit device.
The code for the OSR USB FX-2 driver can be found in the
[Microsoft Windows-driver-samples repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/)
under
[usb/umdf2_fx2/driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/usb/umdf2_fx2/driver).
The driver must be built for Windows 10 version 1703 or higher in order to support
the custom capability used by this sample.

The "Connect to the OSR FX-2 device" scenario demonstrates the following:

- Declaring a custom capability "microsoft.hsaTestCustomCapability_q536wpkpf5cy2" in the manifest.
- Updating driver code or driver INF to enable access to driver interface using the custom capability   
- Using a `DeviceWatcher` to enumerate OSR FX-2 devices by using its device interface GUID.
- Using the `CustomDevice.FromIdAsync` method to access a particular instance of the device.

The "Send IOCTLs to the device" scenario demonstrates the following:

- Sending an IOCTL to the device to set the 7 segment LED value.
- Sending an IOCTL to the device to get the 7 segment LED value.
  - The values and meanings of I/O control codes are defined by the device.

The "Handle asynchronous device events" scenario demonstrates the following:

- Sending an IOCTL that does not complete until the DIP switches change.
- Canceling the task which is waiting for the switches to change.
- Sending an IOCTL to read the current state of the switches.
  - The values and meanings of I/O control codes are defined by the device.

To use this scenario, click "Begin Receiving Switch Change Events" and then
change the DIP switches. The app displays the state of the switches when they
change. You can also click "Get Switch State" to read the switch state immediately.

The "Read and Write operations" scenario demonstrates the following:

- Writing data to the device's internal memory by writing to its OutputStream.
- Reading data from the device's internal memory by reading from its InputStream.

Each time you click "Write Block", a message is written to the device,
and each time you click "Read Block", a message is read from the device.
The OSR FX-2 has four message buffers.
When they are full, the next write operation will wait until a message is read,
thereby freeing up a message buffer.
When they are empty, the next read operation will wait until a message is written.

## Raising Custom System Event Trigger

Demonstrates how to register background task with the CustomSystemEventTrigger type and
raise a custom system event when an OSR FX-2 device is connected to a system. The code to
raise the event is part of the OSR FX-2 driver. This enables custom devices/NT services to raise a custom system event which triggers a background task.

The code for the OSR USB FX-2 driver can be found in the
[Microsoft Windows-driver-samples repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/)
under
[usb/kmdf_fx2/driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/usb/kmdf_fx2).
The driver must be built for Windows 10 version 1803 or higher in order to support
the custom system event trigger used by this sample.

## Firmware access

Declaring the restricted capability `smbios` allows apps to read the SMBIOS.
Call the
[GetSystemFirmwareTable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724379(v=vs.85).aspx)
and
[EnumSystemFirmwareTables](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724259(v=vs.85).aspx)
functions with the 'RSMB' (Raw SMBIOS) table provider.

The following custom capabilities can be used for accessing UEFI variables:

- `microsoft.firmwareRead_cw5n1h2txyewy`: Read UEFI variables using [GetFirmwareEnvironmentVariable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724325(v=vs.85).aspx)
- `microsoft.firmwareWrite_cw5n1h2txyewy`: Read/Write UEFI variables using [SetFirmwareEnvironmentVariable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724934(v=vs.85).aspx)

UEFI access also requires the app to declare 'protectedApp' restricted capability and enable [INTEGRITYCHECK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/integritycheck-require-signature-check) for the project. This would trigger necessary store signing for protected apps during store submission. Currently the [INTEGRITYCHECK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/integritycheck-require-signature-check) can only be enabled on C++ projects properties.

UEFI variables can be accessed only when the app is being used by a user belonging to Administrators group.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
