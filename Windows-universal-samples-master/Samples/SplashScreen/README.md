# Splash screen sample

Shows how to imitate the splash screen that Windows displays for your app by positioning a similar image correctly when Windows dismisses the splash screen that it displays. 

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample uses the [SplashScreen](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224763) class in the 
[Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224766) namespace.

This sample demonstrates these tasks:

-   Responding when the splash screen dismissed event fires
-   Extending the splash screen

Important APIs in this sample include:

-   JavaScript: [onactivated](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br212679) event
-   C#/C++/VB: [Activated](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225018) event 
-   [SplashScreen](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224763) class
