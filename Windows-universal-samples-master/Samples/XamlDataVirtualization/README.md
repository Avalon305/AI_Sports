# Data virtualization sample

Shows how to implement a data source for XAML list controls that implements data virtualization.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Implement IItemsRangeInfo:** Use the IItemsRangeInfo interface to understand which items are in view or the buffer area for a list view, and to manage a cache containing those items.
- **Implement ISelectionInfo:** Use the ISelectionInfo interface to manage the selection of items in the list, accounting for the data virtualization.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
