# Association launching sample

Shows how to launch an app to handle a file type or a protocol (also known as custom scheme). 
You can also learn how to enable your app to be the handler for a file type or a protocol. 

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample covers these key tasks:

- launching an  app for a file using [LaunchFileAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701461)
- handling file activation through the **Activated** event 
- launching an app for a protocol using [LaunchUriAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701476)
- handling protocol activation through the **Activated** event 
- associating the app with a website using the **AppUriHandler** extension
- launching a target app and having the currently running source app remain on the screen for various amounts of screen space using [LauncherOptions.DesiredRemainingView](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314).
- **Note**  [LauncherOptions.DesiredRemainingView](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314) is only supported on desktop Windows when it is running in tablet mode. 

To obtain an insider copy of Windows 10, go to [Windows 10](http://insider.windows.com). 

**Note**  For Windows 10 app samples, go to  [Windows 10 Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples). The samples for Windows 10 can be built and run using Windows developer [tools](https://developer.windows.com).
