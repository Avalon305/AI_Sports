# Advertising sample

Shows how to use the Microsoft Advertising SDK (Microsoft.Advertising) to show display ads and interstitial ads.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- Create an ad control to show display ads using only XAML / HTML markup
- Create an ad control to show display ads programatically
- Create an ad control to show interstitial video ads programatically

## Prerequisites

This sample requires the [Microsoft Advertising SDK Libraries for XAML or JavaScript](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619694),
which is obtained via NuGet package,
or you can [download it here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=518026).
It also requires the [internet client capability](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt270968#general-use_capabilities) to be added to the manifest.

When you incorporate this sample into your own app,
obtain your own ApplicationId and AdUnitId from the Dev Center.
