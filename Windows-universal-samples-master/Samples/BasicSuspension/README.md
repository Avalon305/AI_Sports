# Basic Suspension Sample

Shows how to suspend, shut down and resume your application using the Suspension Manager.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample covers:

- Saving state when the app is suspended or shut down.
- Restoring state when the app is resumed from suspension or reactivated after being shut down.

From the Visual Studio debugging toolbar, use the Lifecycle Events menu to trigger suspend and resume events.

**Note** The Universal Windows app samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

To obtain an insider copy of Windows 10, go to [Windows 10](http://insider.windows.com).

**Note**  For Windows 10 app samples, go to  [Windows 10 Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples). The samples for Windows 10 can be built and run using Windows developer [tools](https://developer.windows.com).
