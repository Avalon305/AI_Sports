# File access sample

Shows how to create, read, write, copy and delete a file, how to retrieve file properties, and how 
to track a file or folder so that your app can access it again. 
This sample uses the [Windows.Storage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227346) and 
[Windows.Storage.AccessCache](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207498) APIs.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The sample demonstrates these tasks:

1.  **Create a file in the Pictures library**

    Uses one of the [StorageFolder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230).[CreateFileAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227249) methods to create the file.

2.  **Get a file's parent folder**

    Uses the [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[GetParentAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298477) method to get the parent folder of the file that was created in the Picture folder. The app has the Pictures library capability, so it can access the folder where the file was created.

3.  **Write and read text in a file**

    Uses the [FileIO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440).[WriteTextAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701505) and [FileIO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440).[ReadTextAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701482) methods to write and read the file. For more info, see [Create, write, and read a file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185401).

4.  **Write and read bytes in a file**

    Uses the [FileIO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440).[WriteBufferAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701490) and [FileIO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440).[ReadBufferAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701468) methods to write and read the file. For more info, see [Create, write, and read a file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185401).

5.  **Write and read a file using a stream**

    Uses the following API to write and read the file using a stream.

    -   [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[OpenTransactedWriteAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh996766) method
    -   [DataWriter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208154) class
    -   [DataReader](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208119) class

    For more info, see [Create, write, and read a file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185401).

6.  **Display file properties**

    Uses the [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[GetBasicPropertiesAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701737) method and the [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[Properties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227225) property to get the properties of the file.

7.  **Track a file or folder so that you can access it later (persisting access)**

    Uses the [StorageApplicationPermissions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207456).[FutureAccessList](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207457) and [StorageApplicationPermissions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207456).[MostRecentlyUsedList](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207458) properties to remember a file or folder so that it can be accessed later.

    For more info, see [Track recently used files and folders](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt186452).

8.  **Copy a file**

    Uses one of the [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[CopyAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227190) methods to copy the file.

9.  **Compare two files to see if they're the same**

    Uses the [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[IsEqual](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298484) method to compare two files.

10. **Delete a file**

    Uses one of the [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[DeleteAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227199) methods to delete the file.

11. **Try to get a file without getting an error**

    Uses the [StorageFolder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230).[TryGetItemAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251721) method to get a file without raising an exception.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select Debug > Start Without Debugging.
