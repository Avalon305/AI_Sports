# Camera profiles sample

Shows a new extension to Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCaptureInitializationSettings API. This new API lets app 
developers query a device for a collection of media types that can work together on a given device called a Video Profile. These new Video Profiles 
expose the capabilities of the capture device which the developer can use to set MediaCaptureInitializationSettings to the desired capabilities. In 
addition, the developer can query the driver to see if it supports additional features available through custom profiles.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample covers:

Scenario 1: Locate a Record Specific Profile: You can use profiles to verify if a camera supports a specific resolution or
custom setting via querying for video profile. We demonstrate two methods:
1. When you choose "Find 640x480 30 FPS Recording Profile" button, we determine if the back video capture device supports
   a camera profile with a 640x480(WVGA) 30 FPS resolution. We first check if the back video capture device supports a Video
   Profile. We iterate through all the profiles the device supports to demonstrate available Video Profiles on the device. Then
   we search for the 640x480(WVGA) 30 FPS profile. If located, we initialize Media Capture Settings with this profile.
2. When you choose the "Find Custom Recording Profile" button, we are looking to see if a device supports a specific Custom
   Profile. The custom profile would allow the camera driver to optimize for additional features. For this demonstration we use
   a static profile for 640x480 30 FPS that is avaliable in the phone emulators.

Scenario 2: Query Profile for Concurrency: This scenarios demonstrates using profiles to determine if a device is capable of streaming
from both the front and rear video capture devices at the same time.
1. When you choose "Query for Concurrent Profile button, the app queries for a front and back device that supports a video profile. If a profile
   is supported on both devices we then check the devices for profiles that support concurrency. From the available profiles we look for a concurrent profile match on both
   devices. If a concurrent profile match is found, we initialize both front and back Media Capture settings of the devices to the concurrency profile.
     
Scenario 3: Query Profile for Hdr Support: This scenarios demonstrates using Camera Profile to determine if a device is capable of supporting
Hdr Video.
1. When you choose "Query Profile for HDR Support" button, the app will query the if the back video capture device supports a Video Profile. Then we query the available profiles
   to see if Hdr Video is supported calling the IsHdrVideoSupported() method. If so, we set Media Capture settings to the Hdr supported video profile and set Hdr Video mode to auto.

Note that not all cameras will have camera profiles.
They are needed only if the camera has combinations of pins or media types which cannot be used simultaneously,
such as a camera which cannot capture at the highest photo resolution
while simultaneously streaming at the highest video resolution.

Developers who wish to test their profile logic should target MIPI-based cameras
that expose multiple pins.
Example of these cameras are various QC SOC-based devices
(such as the Lumia 950/950XL and HP Elite X3)
or Intel MIPI-based systems
(such as the Surface Pro, Surface Pro 4, Surface Book,
and Surface Laptop).
Note that for the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book 1,
the latest 4731 camera drivers publish profiles,
but the factory image drivers do not.

System requirements
-----------------------------
Camera that supports Video Profiles

**Client:** Windows 10

**Phone:** Windows 10

Build the sample
----------------

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

Run the sample
--------------

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

**Deploying the sample**
1.  Select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**.

**Deploying and running the sample**
1.  To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
