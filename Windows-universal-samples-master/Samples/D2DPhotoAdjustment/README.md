# Direct2D photo adjustment sample

Shows how to build a photo viewer and editor using [Direct2D](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd370990) and [Direct2D Effects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh706327).

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- Efficiently load images into Direct2D
- Setup and control a photo photo editing pipeline
- Hook up UI in XAML

This sample uses the following Direct2D effects:
- [Color management](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh706318)
- [Straighten](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn900462)
- [Temperature and tint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn900463)
- [Saturation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh706369)
- [Contrast](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn890716)
- [Highlights and Shadows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn890773)

## Sample project files

The sample's project files fall into the following categories.

### Sample-specific files
The following files form the main educational content of the sample:

- **DirectXPage.xaml/.cpp/.h/:** Implements a XAML-based UI to drive the photo pipeline. Hosts the DirectX content in a SwapChainPanel.
- **App.xaml/.cpp/.h:** The app's main entry point.
- **D2DPhotoAdjustmentRenderer.cpp/.h:** The core implementation of the Direct2D photo pipeline using effects.
- **D2DPhotoAdjustmentProperties.h:** Defines the struct used for databinding effect properties with the UI.

### DirectX SDK sample common files
The following files provide common functionality needed by DirectX SDK samples:

- **DeviceResources.cpp/.h:** Manages creation and lifetime of the core Direct3D and Direct2D device-dependent resources. Handles cases such as device lost and window size and orientation changes.
- **DirectXHelper.h:** Common inline helper functions, including ThrowIfFailed which converts HRESULT-based APIs into an exception model.
- **SampleOverlay.cpp/.h:** Renders the Windows SDK overlay badge on top of sample content.

All DX SDK samples and the Visual Studio template DX project contain a version of these files. These common files demonstrate important best practices for DX UWP apps, and you are encouraged to use them in your own projects.

### C++ UWP common files
Variants of the following files are found in every UWP app written in C++:

- Package.appxmanifest
- pch.cpp/.h
- D2DPhotoAdjustment.vcxproj
- D2DPhotoAdjustment.vcxproj.filters
- D2DPhotoAdjustment.sln

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.
