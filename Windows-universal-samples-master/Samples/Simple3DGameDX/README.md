# Direct3D game sample

Shows the basic end-to-end implementation of a simple first person 3-D game using DirectX (Direct3D 11.2, Direct2D, Windows.Gaming.Input, and XAudio2) in a C++ app.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample supports:

- A touch input model
- A mouse and keyboard input model
- A game controller input model
- Stereoscopic 3-D display
- A Direct2D heads-up display
- A persistent game state
- Sound effect playback

There are two versions of this sample:

- **Simple3DGameDX**: Uses DirectX to render game UI and implements its own layout.
- **Simple3DGameXaml**: Uses XAML to render game UI and handle layout.

Both versions share significant amounts of logic: the Common and GameContent folders are identical. In addition, to reduce disk space usage, Simple3DGameXaml references some its assets from the Simple3DGameDX\Cpp\Assets folder.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or selectDebug > Start Without Debugging.
