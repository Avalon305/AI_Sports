# Basic face tracking sample

Shows how to use the [FaceTracker](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.media.faceanalysis.facetracker.aspx) 
class to find human faces within an video stream.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Initialize and manage** the FaceTracker object
- **Start a live webcam capture** and display the video stream
- **Execute face tracking** to find human faces within the video stream
- **Acquire video frames** from the video capture stream and convert it to a format supported by FaceTracker
- **Retrieve results** from FaceTracker and visualize them

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

The FaceTracker is intended to operate on a running video stream and is optimized to find and track human faces in real-time. In order to detect human faces within a static image or a single video frame, use the FaceDetector API instead.
