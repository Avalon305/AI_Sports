# File search sample

Shows how to query files in a location (like a folder, library, device, or network location). 
Uses the [Windows.Storage.Search](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208106) API.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Important APIs in this sample include:

-   [QueryOptions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207995) class
-   [StorageFileQueryResult](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208046) class
-   [StorageFolder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230).[CreateFileQueryWithOptions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211591) method

For a walkthrough, see [Quickstart: Accessing files programmatically](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj150596).

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
