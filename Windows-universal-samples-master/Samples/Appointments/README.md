An appointment ID is a **String** object that represents the appointment. Use the 
[ShowAddAppointmentAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn297256) API to obtain an appointment ID of the appointment to add. 
Use this appointment ID with the [ShowReplaceAppointmentAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn297283) or 
[ShowRemoveAppointmentAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn297269) API to update or remove the appointment. 

For more info about how to manage appointments, see [Managing appointments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt269389).
