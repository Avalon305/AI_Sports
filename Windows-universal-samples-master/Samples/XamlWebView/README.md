# WebView control (XAML) sample

Shows how to use the XAML [WebView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.aspx)
control.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to

* Load different types of content into the WebView
  * Navigate the Webview to a URI with the
    [Navigate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.navigate.aspx)
    method.
  * Load string content into the WebView with the
    [NavigateToString](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.navigatetostring.aspx)
    method.
  * Load a file from the app package into the WebView using the
    [ms-appx-web](https://technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/jj655406#ms_appx_web) protocol.
  * Load a file from the app's file system storage into the WebView using the
    [ms-appdata](https://technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/jj655406#ms_appdata) protocol.
  * Custom loading of HTML and support files (such as CSS, script, and images) with the
    [NavigateToLocalStreamUri](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.navigatetolocalstreamuri.aspx)
    method
    and an implementation of the
    [IUriToStreamResolver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.web.iuritostreamresolver.aspx)
    interface.

* Obtain information about the WebView
  * Show a progress ring and Stop button during loading.
  * Update the Backward and Forward buttons based on the WebView navigation history.
  * Obtain a screenshot of the current WebView content with the
    [CapturePreviewToStreamAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.capturepreviewtostreamasync.aspx)
    method.

* Interact with the WebView
  * Call a JavaScript function in the WebView and obtain the result
    with the
    [InvokeScriptAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.invokescriptasync.aspx)
    method.
  * Receive information from WebView-hosted script by handling the
    [ScriptNotify](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.scriptnotify.aspx)
    event.
  * Respond to requests from the WebView to enter full screen.

* Support the Share contract by using the
  [CaptureSelectedContentToDataPackageAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.captureselectedcontenttodatapackageasync.aspx)
  method to obtain the current selection of the WebView.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
