# Barcode scanner sample

Shows how to obtain a barcode scanner, claim it for exclusive use, enable it to receive data, and read a barcode.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample shows how to:

1.  **Obtain the barcode scanner**

    Uses a [**DeviceWatcher**](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceWatcher)
    to enumerate and select the first barcode scanner.

2.  **Claim the barcode scanner for exclusive use**

    Uses [ClaimScannerAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn297696) to claim the device.

3.  **Add event handlers**

    Uses [DataReceived](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278556) and [ReleaseDeviceRequested](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278578) events.

    When an application gets a request to release its exclusive claim to the barcode scanner, it must handle the request by retaining the device; otherwise, it will lose its claim. The second scenario in this sample shows the release and retain functionality. The event handler for [ReleaseDeviceRequested](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278578) shows how retain the device.

4.  **Set active symbologies**

    Uses the [GetSupportedSymbologiesAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.pointofservice.barcodescanner.getsupportedsymbologiesasync) method
    to determine which symbologies are supported by the scanner
    and the [SetActiveSymbologiesAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.setactivesymbologiesasync) method
    to specify which symbologies are active.

5. **Set symbology attributes**

    Uses the [GetSymbologyAttributesAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.getsymbologyattributesasync) method
    to determine what symbology attributes are supported by the scanner
    and the [SetSymbologyAttributesAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.setsymbologyattributesasync) method
    to enable or disable them.

6. **Control camera-based barcode scanners**

   Detects camera-based barcode scanners by checking the [VideoDeviceId](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.barcodescanner.videodeviceid) property
   and shows an in-app preview of the barcode camera.
   Shows and hides the video preview window with the [ShowVideoPreviewAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.showvideopreviewasync)
   and [HideVideoPreview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.hidevideopreview) methods.
   Controls the software trigger with the [StartSoftwareTriggerAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.startsoftwaretriggerasync)
   and [StopSoftwareTrigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.stopsoftwaretriggerasync) methods.

The app package manifest shows how to specify the device capability name for the Point of Service (POS) devices. All POS apps are required declare [DeviceCapability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211430) in the app package manifest, either by using "PointofService" as shown in this sample or by using a device specific GUID, such as "C243FFBD-3AFC-45E9-B3D3-2BA18BC7EBC5" for a barcode scanner.

**Note** The Universal Windows app samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:** Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or selectDebug > Start Without Debugging.
