                Formats the current date and time using
                the Long and Short formats. These formats represent conventional
                presentation forms for date and time and are useful when presenting
                standard date and times. The available formats are shown in Settings
                under Time &amp; Language.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default the dates and times are formatted according to the conventions
                of the current application language.
                (In the case of this sample, only a single default language is supported.)
                For a localized application, the current language is determined by
                the user's language preferences.
