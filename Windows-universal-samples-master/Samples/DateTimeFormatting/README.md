# Date and time formatting sample

Shows how to use the [DateTimeFormatter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206828)
class in the [Windows.Globalization.DateTimeFormatting](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206859)
namespace to display dates and times according to the user's preferences.

> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be

The **DateTimeFormatter**
class provides a globally-aware method for formatting a date or time into a string for display to a user.
It can either use the default preferences of the current user,
or the caller can override these to specify other languages, geographic region,
and clock and calendar systems.
The caller can request a format using the well-known constants
(shorttime, longtime, shortdate or longdate) or define the specific elements required.

The sample also uses the [Windows.Globalization.CalendarIdentifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br229460)
and [Windows.Globalization.ClockIdentifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br229462) classes.

This sample contains scenarios that demonstrate:

-   How to format the current date and time using the Long and Short formats.
-   How to format the current date and time using custom formats that are specified using a template string or a parameterized template.
-   How to format dates and times by overriding the user's default global context. This is used when an app presents dates or times that reflect different settings from the user's current defaults.
-   How to format dates and times by using Unicode extensions in specified languages, overriding the user's default global context if applicable.
-   How to convert and format the current date and time using the time zone support available in the [Format](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn264145) method.
