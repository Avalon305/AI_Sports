# Library management sample

Shows how to get a list of the folders in a user's library and how to let users add and remove folders from that list. This samples uses 
[Windows.Storage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227346).[StorageLibrary](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251722).

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The sample demonstrates these tasks:

1.  **Add a folder to a library**

    Uses [StorageLibrary.GetLibraryAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251725) to get a specific library and [StorageLibrary.RequestAddFolderAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251726) to display a file picker that the user can use to select a folder to add to the library.

2.  **List the folders in a library**

    Uses [StorageLibrary.GetLibraryAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251725) to get a specific library and [StorageLibrary.Folders](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251724) to get a list of folders in the library.

3.  **Remove a folder from a library**

    Uses [StorageLibrary.GetLibraryAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251725) to get a specific library and [StorageLibrary.Folders](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251724) to display a list of folders in the library so the user can select one to remove. Then uses [StorageLibrary.RequestRemoveFolderAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn251727) to remove the folder if the user approves.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
