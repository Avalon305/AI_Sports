# Disabling selection sample

Shows how your app can make content areas in your JavaScript app unselectable using the 
[-ms-user-select](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh779846) CSS attribute.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

By default, all content in the UI of a JavaScript app can be selected by a user and copied to the clipboard. 
However, access to UI elements (such as text, images, and other proprietary content) can be limited by excluding them from this default 
behavior with [-ms-user-select](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh779846).

[-ms-user-select](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh779846) supports the following values:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Term
Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>none</p>
<p>Blocks selection from starting on that element. It will not block an existing selection from entering the element.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>element</p>
<p>Enables selection to start within the element; however, the selection is contained by the bounds of that element.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
