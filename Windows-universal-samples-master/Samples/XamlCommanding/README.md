# Commanding sample

Shows the changes and new features for the CommandBar.  On Windows 10, both the AppBar and the CommandBar are visible by default and can be either 
"closed" or "opened". While in the closed state, an app bar can provide either a "minimal" or "compact" hint or no hint at all.  
The AppBar/CommandBar transition to an opened state when the user taps the More button that appears as an ellipsis or the control is opened programmatically. 

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample shows:

- **Buttons for the CommandBar:** The AppBarButton, AppBarToggleButton, and AppBarSeparator can be used as any other button, but are 
optimized for use on the CommandBar control.  A soft-hyphen character can be used to hint at where the label should wrap. 
- **Default Icons:** The default set of icons for Windows 10 comes from the Segoe MDL2 Assets font.  The font metrics are such that the 
glyphs can be used similar to scalable vector images where they fill the specified size.
- **Opening/Closing events:** This sample demonstrates the new Opening and Closing events and how the existing Opened and Closed events 
fire after the animation completes.
- **Styling:** The CommandBar includes an overflow menu which can be styled separate from the bar which displays the PrimaryCommands.
- **Hosting Custom Content:** The CommandBar now provides support for displaying UI set as the Content.  This enables more customized 
commanding scenarios while still utilizing the structured commanding surface for Primary or Secondary commands in addition to attached Flyouts.
- **Adapting to Screen Sizes:** The default control does not reflow commands to/from the overflow as the available space changes.  
This demonstrates how it can be achieved by subclassing the CommandBar and including additionl logic in the control's MeasureOverride.  

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
