# Calendar sample

Shows how to use the [Calendar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206724) class in the
[Windows.Globalization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.globalization.aspx)
namespace to manipulate and process dates based on a calendar system and the user's globalization preferences.
(If you are looking for a sample which demonstrates an appointment calendar, see the [Appointments](../Appointments) sample.)

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The
[Calendar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206724)
class provides details of the user's default calendar or a caller-specified calendar system.
The class gives access to specific statistical details
as well as the ability to perform calendar-aware math operations.

The Calendar object can convert to and from a language-specific date type:

* C++: [Windows::Foundation::DateTime](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.foundation.datetime.aspx)
* C#: [DateTimeOffset](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/system.datetimeoffset.aspx)
* JavaScript: [Date](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/cd9w2te4.aspx)

The sample also uses the
[Windows.Globalization.CalendarIdentifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br229460)
and
[Windows.Globalization.ClockIdentifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br229462)
classes.

This sample contains scenarios that demonstrate:

* How to create a calendar for the user's default preferences or for specific overrides, and how to display calendar details. 

* How to determine statistics for the current calendar date and time, such as the number of days in this month and the number of months in this year. 

* How to enumerate through a calendar and perform calendar math, such as determining the number of hours in a day that spans the transition from Daylight Saving Time. 
This scenario also demonstrates converting from a language-specific date type to a Calendar.

* How to create a calendar using language names with supported Unicode extension tags, and how the extension tags are used by the calendar object. 

* How to support time zones in calendars, by changing several time zones within a calendar and showing the effect of the time zone change in the date and time properties of the calendar. 

* How to convert between calendars and a language-specific date type.
