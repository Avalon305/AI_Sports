# Display orientation sample

Shows how to use the [DisplayInformation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn264258)
class for retrieving the display orientation and setting an app's auto-rotation orientation preferences.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- Read the native display orientation.
- Read the current display orientation.
- Respond to changes in display orientation.
- Set auto-rotation orientation preferences.

This sample does not show how to adjust accelerometer data based
on the display orientation.
For a demonstration of how to perform the adjustment,
see the Orientation Changed scenario of the [the Accelerometer sample](../Accelerometer).

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)
