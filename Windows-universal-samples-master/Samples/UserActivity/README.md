# UserActivity sample

Shows how to use the [UserActivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.useractivities.useractivity) 
class to discover and interact with other computers.

- Populate UserActivity objects with advanced metadata such as ContentUri, FallbackUri, Attribution, BackgroundColor and Description.
- Associate an AdaptiveCard with a UserActivity.
