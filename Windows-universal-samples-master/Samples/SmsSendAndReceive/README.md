# SMS send and receive sample

Shows how to use the SMS API (Windows.Devices.Sms)

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to: 

- Send text message.
- Set filter rules for registering with background infrastructure and then receiving the SMS based on filter rules.

Windows.Devices.Sms is a low-level API intended for use by mobile operators
to push information to apps on devices by using SMS as the signaling channel.
For example, a mobile operator may send a specially-formatted SMS message
to signal the voicemail app that the number of unread messages has changed.

If you are interested in writing a chat app
for sending and receiving messages that are visible to end users,
then use the Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat namespace instead.

## Prerequisites

This sample accesses privileged APIs used by mobile broadband operators.
Hence it requires the **cellularMessaging** capability,
a [special-use capability](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt270968#special_and_restricted_capabilities),
to be declared in the package manifest.

### Remark

- This sample will not pass WACK because it uses a special-use capability.
- This sample requires phone devices to be OEM developer unlocked.

### Reference
