# Holographic Mixed Reality Capture sample

Shows how to capture mixed reality photo and video by using Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture and
MixedRealityCapture video/audio effects.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

## Holographic Mixed Reality Capture sample application (HolographicMRCapture solution)

This solution is based on the Holographic DirectX application template with basic UI controls and a custom MediaCaptureManager class.

The MediaCaptureManager class manages the Windows::Media::Capture::MediaCapture runtime class and adds/removes Mixed Reality Capture Audio and Video effects.

## Mixed Reality Capture (MRC) Effect Definitions (MrcEffectDefinitions solution)

Reusable solution to make using mixed reality capture video and audio effects more convenient.
This solution contains audio and video effect definitions for the built-in
MixedRealityCaptureAudioEffect and MixedRealityCaptureVideoEffect classes.

## Additional remarks

**Note** The Windows universal samples for Windows 10 Holographic require Visual Studio 2017 Update 2
to build, and a Windows Holographic device to execute. Windows Holographic devices include the
Microsoft HoloLens and the Microsoft HoloLens Emulator.

To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421).

To obtain information about the tools used for Windows Holographic development, including
Visual Studio and the Microsoft HoloLens Emulator, go to
[Install the tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools).

## Reference

The following are used to demonstrate spatial mapping in this code sample:

* [Windows.Media.Capture namespace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.media.capture.aspx)
  * [MediaCapture class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.media.capture.mediacapture.aspx)

* [Mixed reality capture for developers](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/holographic/mixed_reality_capture_for_developers)

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10 Holographic

**Phone:** Not supported

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with
   the sample you want to build.
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the
   subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or
   JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and
run it.

### Deploying the sample to the Microsoft HoloLens emulator

- Click the debug target drop-down, and select **Microsoft HoloLens Emulator**.
- Select **Build** \> **Deploy** Solution.

### Deploying the sample to a Microsoft HoloLens

- Developer unlock your Microsoft HoloLens. For instructions, go to
  [Enable your device for development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#enable-your-windows-10-devices).
- Find the IP address of your Microsoft HoloLens. The IP address can be found in **Settings**
  \> **Network & Internet** \> **Wi-Fi** \> **Advanced options**. Or, you can ask Cortana for this
  information by saying: "Hey Cortana, what's my IP address?"
- Right-click on your project in Visual Studio, and then select **Properties**.
- In the Debugging pane, click the drop-down and select **Remote Machine**.
- Enter the IP address of your Microsoft HoloLens into the field labelled **Machine Name**.
- Click **OK**.
- Select **Build** \> **Deploy** Solution.

### Pairing your developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens with Visual Studio

The first time you deploy from your development PC to your developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens,
you will need to use a PIN to pair your PC with the Microsoft HoloLens.
- When you select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**, a dialog box will appear for Visual Studio to
  accept the PIN.
- On your Microsoft HoloLens, go to **Settings** \> **Update** \> **For developers**, and click on
  **Pair**.
- Type the PIN displayed by your Microsoft HoloLens into the Visual Studio dialog box and click
  **OK**.
- On your Microsoft HoloLens, select **Done** to accept the pairing.
- The solution will then start to deploy.

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, follow the steps listed above to connect your
  developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens, then press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**.
  To run  the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
