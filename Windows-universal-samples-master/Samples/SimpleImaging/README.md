# Simple imaging sample

Shows some common imaging scenarios for Universal Windows apps including metadata and editing/saving.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample demonstrates how to:

- Read, process and edit common image metadata and properties including:
  - EXIF orientation
  - Author, title, and keywords
  - Geotags
- Perform scaling and rotation while respecting EXIF orientation
- Optimize image saving

## Sample contents

### C# version

- **Scenario1.xaml**, **Scenario1.xaml.cs**: Use the property system APIs (Windows.Storage.FileProperties) to read and edit bitmap properties from an image.
- **Scenario2.xaml**, **Scenario2.xaml.cs**: Use the imaging APIs (Windows.Graphics.Imaging) to read and edit bitmap properties and apply transformations such as scale, crop and rotate.
- **Helpers.cs**: Helper functionality including handling/converting EXIF orientation values.

All other files provide common SDK sample functionality.

### JS version

- **css\scenario1.css**, **html\scenario1.html**, **js\scenario1.js**: Use the property system APIs (Windows.Storage.FileProperties) to read and edit bitmap properties from an image.
- **css\scenario2.css**, **html\scenario2.html**, **js\scenario2.js**: Use the imaging APIs (Windows.Graphics.Imaging) to read and edit bitmap properties and apply transformations such as scale, crop and rotate.
- **js\helpers.cs**: Helper functionality including handling/converting EXIF orientation values.

All other files provide common SDK sample functionality.

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:** Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or selectDebug > Start Without Debugging.
