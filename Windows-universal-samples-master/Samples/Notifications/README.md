> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file,

There are many scenarios in this sample broken down to three major sections:
 
- Badge

or their attention is needed due to an event. They can also convey user status in a chat application.

**Scenarios include:**

- Setting a numerical badge onto a primary tile 
- Setting a glyph badge onto a primary tile
- Clearing badges
- Setting badges to secondary tiles

### LiveTile
