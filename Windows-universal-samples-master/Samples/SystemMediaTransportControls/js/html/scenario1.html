                Select some audio or video files to play. Then use media keys such as &quot;Play/Pause&quot;, &quot;Previous&quot; or &quot;Next&quot; on the keyboard to control playback. Observe the system flyout displayed on the screen&apos;s upper right. Try bringing
                up the flyout with keyboard keys (or hardware buttons on a tablet device) for volume up and volume down. Use (with mouse or touch) the flyout&apos;s software buttons to control playback.

            HTML5 specifies that both audio and video content are supported by both <audio> and <video> elements.
            <audio> elements simply do not render the video stream, so for this sample we will use <video> to
            play video as well as audio-only content.

            HTML5 audio and video elements share more or less the same properties, methods and events, so the same
            sample script code would work basically unmodified with an <audio> element below in place of <video>.
