# File and folder thumbnail sample

Shows how to retrieve thumbnails for files and folders using [Windows.Storage.FileProperties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207831).

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The sample demonstrates these tasks:

1.  **Retrieve a thumbnail for a picture**

2.  **Retrieve album art as the thumbnail for a song**

3.  **Retrieve an icon as the thumbnail for a document**

4.  **Retrieve a thumbnail for a folder in the file system**

    **Note**  You can't retrieve a thumbnail for the Pictures library itself because it is a virtual folder. You must choose a file system folder that has pictures in it in order to retrieve a thumbnail.

5.  **Retrieve a thumbnail for a file group**

    A file group is a virtual folder where all the files in the group have the criteria that you specify in common. For example, the sample shows a thumbnail for a file group wherein the files in the group all have the same month and year.

To learn about retrieving the appropriate thumbnail to display to the user, see [Guidelines and checklist for thumbnails](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465350).

Important APIs in this sample include:

-   [StorageItemThumbnail](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207802) class
-   [ThumbnailMode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207809) enumeration
-   [StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171).[GetThumbnailAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227210) methods
-   [StorageFolder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230).[GetThumbnailAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227288) methods
-   [IStorageItemProperties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701614).[GetThumbnailAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701636) methods

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
