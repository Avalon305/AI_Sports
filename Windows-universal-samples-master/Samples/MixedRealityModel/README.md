# Mixed Reality Model sample

Shows how you to place 3D content using Secondary Tiles by defining a mixed reality model at creation time.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Create a 3D app launcher:** Define a 3D launcher asset in the app manifest to override the default 2D launcher for your app.
- **Create a 3D Secondary Tile:** Place 3D models from your app into the Windows Mixed Reality home.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)
