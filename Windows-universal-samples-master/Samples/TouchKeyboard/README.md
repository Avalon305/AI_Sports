# Touch keyboard sample

Shows both the default display behavior of the touch keyboard and how that behavior can be customized in a UWP app.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how:

* XAML text controls (such as TextBox, RichTextBox, and PaswordBox) display the touch keyboard by default.
* Controls derived from XAML text controls display the touch keyboard by default.
* Apps can subscribe to events indicating when the touch keyboard is shown and hidden.
* Apps can request that the touch keyboard be shown or hidden.

**Note** The touch keyboard does not automatically display if a hardware keyboard is connected,
or the device is in Desktop mode and "Show the touch keyboard when not in tablet mode and there's no keyboard attached" is set to "Off" in **Settings -> Devices -> Typing**.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

**Note** <a href="../CustomEditControl">Custom text edit control sample</a> shows how to manage the visibility of the touch keyboard programatically.
