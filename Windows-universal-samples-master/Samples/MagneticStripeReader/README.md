# Magnetic stripe reader sample

Shows how to create a magnetic stripe reader, claim it for exclusive use, enable it to receive data, and read data from a bank card or a motor vehicle card. 
This sample uses the [Windows.Devices.PointOfService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298071) API.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

1.  **Get the magnetic stripe reader**

    Uses a [**DeviceWatcher**](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceWatcher)
    to enumerate and select the first magnetic stripe reader.

2.  **Claim the magnetic stripe reader for exclusive use**

    Uses [ClaimReaderAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn297979) to claim the device.

3.  **Add event handlers**

    Uses [BankCardDataReceived](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278599), [AamvaCardDataReceived](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278595), and [ReleaseDeviceRequested](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278626) events.

    When an application gets a request from another application to release its exclusive claim to the magnetic stripe reader, it must handle the request by retaining the device; otherwise, it will lose its claim. The event handler for [ReleaseDeviceRequested](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278626) shows how to do this.

4.  **Enable the device to receive data**

    Uses [EnableAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278612).

The app package manifest shows how to specify the device capability name for the Point of Service (POS) devices. All POS apps are required declare [DeviceCapability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211430) in the app package manifest, either by using "PointofService" as shown in this sample or by using device specific GUID, such as "2A9FE532-0CDC-44F9-9827-76192F2CA2FB" for a magnetic stripe reader.

The following list shows the magnetic stripe readers that were used with this code sample:

-   MagTek MagneSafe HID USB reader (VID 0801, PID 0011)
-   MagTek SureSwipe HID USB reader ( VID 0801, PID 0002)
-   MagTek BulleT Bluetooth/USB reader, when connected via USB (VID 0801, PID 0011)
-   ID TECH SecureMag HID USB reader (VID 0ACD, PID 2010)
-   ID TECH MiniMag HID USB reader (VID 0ACD, PID 0500)

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:** Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or selectDebug > Start Without Debugging.
