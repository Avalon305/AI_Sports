# Basic media casting sample

Shows how to use the **Windows.Media.Casting** namespace to render media on a remote device. 
Covers sending media to various devices: Miracast, DLNA, and Bluetooth. For more advanced functionality see the [Advanced Casting Sample](../AdvancedCasting).

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

**Scenario 1: Basic Media Casting:**
Press the *Load Video* button to open a video.  Press the *Cast* button under the progress bar in the video element.  Select the device you'd like to cast to.

This is an example of the built in casting that comes with the media element transport controls.  This will enable casting to Miracast, DLNA, and Bluetooth devices.

**Scenario 2: Casting Using Casting Picker:**  
Again, press the *Load Video* Button.  Then press the *Cast Button* to it's right.  Finally select the device you'd like to cast to.

Very similar to the first sample, but this one allows you to further customize the device picker. 

**Scenario 3: Casting Using Custom Picker**  
Again, press the *Load Video* Button.  Then press the *Start Device Watcher*.  Finally select a device from the list that appears below.

This sample illustrates how to build a completely custom UX for selecting devices.  It uses the casting APIs in conjunctions with the **Windows.Devices.Enumeration** APIs.

2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

Run the sample
