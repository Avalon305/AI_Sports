> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows:

* MapControl Basics: adjusting the ZoomLevel, Heading, DesiredPitch, map style, and map projection
* Adding points of interest on the map: PushPins, images, billboards, 3D models and shapes
* Adding multiple layers (points of interests on the map) on the map
* Adding XAML overlays on the map
* Showing 3D locations in MapControl
* Showing Streetside experience within MapControl
* Launching Maps using URI Schemes
* Displaying points of interest with clustering
* Finding and downloading Offline Maps
* Customizing the map appearance by using style sheets
* Customizing the map elements appearance more deeply by using style entries and states
