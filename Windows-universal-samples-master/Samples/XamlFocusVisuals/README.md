# Focus visuals sample

Shows how to take advantage of the new system drawn focus visuals, or to create your own custom focus visuals if the system drawn ones do not fit your needs.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Use the system focus visuals in custom controls:** By using UseSystemFocusVisuals and the attached property Control.IsTemplateFocusTarget, you can specify which piece of your control template should draw the focus visuals.
- **Create your own focus visuals:** Add back the focus visual states from Windows 8.1 (included in the sample), and set UseSystemFocusVisuals to false to specify your own visuals.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
