# Contact cards sample

Shows how to display contact cards using methods of the
[ContactManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.contacts.contactmanager.aspx)
class.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample has three scenarios.

- **Show mini contact card**

  Mini contact cards appear as a pop-up window inside the app.
  Apps provide an anchor rectangle around which the mini card will be displayed
  and can provide a suggested position of the mini contact card relative to the anchor rectangle.
  The [ShowContactCard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.contacts.contactmanager.showcontactcard.aspx)
  method displays a mini contact card.

- **Show mini contact card with delay loaded-data**

  Display the mini contact card immediately
  while the app obtains additional information about the contact in the background.
  The card is updated when the additional information is available.
  The [ShowDelayLoadedContactCard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.contacts.contactmanager.showdelayloadedcontactcard.aspx)
  method displays a delay loaded mini contact card.

- **Show full contact card**

  Full contact cards appear as a separate window.
  The [ShowFullContactCard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.contacts.contactmanager.showfullcontactcard.aspx)
  method displays a full contact card.

Not all devices support mini contact cards.
The samples also demonstrate how to detect support for mini contact cards.

**Note** The Universal Windows app samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)
