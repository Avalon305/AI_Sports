# Accelerometer sample

Shows how to use the [Accelerometer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225687) class, and 
allows the user to view the acceleration forces along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes for a 3-axis accelerometer.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The sample asks you to choose an accelerometer.

- The standard accelerometer reports total acceleration.
- The linear accelerometer reports acceleration due to motion.
- The gravity accelerometer reports acceleration due to gravity.

After choosing your accelerometer, you can choose one of these scenarios:

-   Accelerometer data events
-   Accelerometer shake events
-   Poll accelerometer readings
-   Accelerometer orientation changed
-   Accelerometer data events batching

### Accelerometer Data Events

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Data Events** option, the app begins streaming accelerometer readings in real time.

### Accelerometer Shake Events

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Shake Events** option, the app displays the cumulative number of shake events each time an event occurs. (The app first increments the event count and then renders the most recent value.)

Note that support for the Shaken event is dependent upon hardware and driver support.
In practice, very few accelerometers support the Shaken event.

### Poll Accelerometer Readings

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Polling** option, the app will retrieve the sensor readings at a fixed interval.

### Accelerometer Orientation Changed

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **OrientationChange** option, the app will display both raw sensor readings, as well as sensor readings that align with the current display orientation.

### Accelerometer data events batching

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Data Events** option, the app begins streaming accelerometer readings. The readings may be delivered in batches if the device supports data batching.

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10 build 14295

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:** Windows 10 build 14295

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or selectDebug > Start Without Debugging.
