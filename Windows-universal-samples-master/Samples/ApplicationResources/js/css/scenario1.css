/*
A background image can be referenced in a logical way that
excludes scale or other qualifications, but a physical image 
in the package with specific scale or other qualifications 
is loaded.

Note: when images with scale variations are managed using 
the Windows resource technology, width and height should 
always be set, as is done here using background-size. If 
no dimensions are set, then the HTML layout engine will 
scale whatever image is loaded using the scale plateau 
for the current display. For example, on a 1.4x display, 
an image with physical size of 112 x 112 might be loaded, 
but if background-size were not specified, that would be 
stretched to 157 x 157.
