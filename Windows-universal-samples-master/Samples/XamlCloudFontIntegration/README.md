# Downloadable fonts (XAML) sample

Shows XAML integration of DirectWrite downloadable fonts, a feature added in Windows 10.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The downloadable font mechanism used in this sample is directly integrated into XAML and can be leveraged in apps just by formatting XAML 
text elements using Windows fonts. No special APIs or markup are required.

##Sample project files
The sample is intended to demonstrate the runtime behavior of the DirectWrite downloadable mechanism that is integrated into XAML. 
The following project files are of particular interest for this sample:

* The Scenario\_Document1.\*, Scenario\_Document2.\* and Scenario\_Document3.\* files are the specific files in which the downloadable font mechanism is demonstrated. 
* The Scenario\_SampleOverview.\* files provide guidance for using the sample app.
* The Scenario\_CloudFontOverview.\* files provide more information about the downloadable font mechanism.

The ClearDownloadableFontCache.ps1 file is not part of the sample project itself, but is a PowerShell script that can be used to reset the state of the 
downloadable font mechanism (clearing cached data) before or after running the sample app. Instructions for using this script are given in the sample app.

Other files are boilerplate files used for UWP sample apps.

The downloadable font mechanism can be utilized just by formatting text elements using Windows fonts. In this sample app, the particular font choices are 
applied programmatically at runtime rather than directly in XAML markup. This is done so that the behavior of the mechanism will be experienced while the 
app is running, rather than when the XAML source files are viewed in Visual Studio.

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample
