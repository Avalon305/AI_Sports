# Simple inking sample

Shows how to use ink functionality (such as capturing ink from user input and performing handwriting recognition on ink strokes) in Universal Windows apps using C#.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample covers using the Windows.UI.Input.Inking APIs to do the following:
-   Capture user input and render as ink strokes
-   Create an ink toolbar which is associated with an ink canvas
-   Add custom buttons to the ink toolbar
-   Create an ink toolbar with only specified buttons
-   Control multiple ink canvases with a single ink toolbar
-   Save and load ink strokes
-   Erase ink strokes
-   Create and select different types of pens
-   Change which input types (Mouse/Touch/Pen) are used for inking
-   Recognize handwriting from ink strokes
-   Select ink strokes
-   Create a ruler and protractor, show them, hide them, customize them, and reposition them
-   Manipulate wet ink strokes
    - make strokes follow a shape
    - complete a stroke prematurely if conditions are met
-   Use ink stroke timestamps to replay ink strokes
-   Use a png as the background of an InkToolbarCustomPenButton and bind its color to the SelectedBrush property of the buttons
-   Change the rendering of the strokes and the color palette change by changing the high contrast adjustment mode
-   Enable pencil tilt
