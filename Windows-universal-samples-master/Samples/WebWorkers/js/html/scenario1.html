            Standards-based Web Workers are supported for multithreaded JavaScript apps. Web Workers can improve the responsiveness of your app by removing tasks from the UI thread. Web Workers can use the postMessage function to communicate with the UI thread.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example uses two Web Workers to calculate prime numbers. Even though this task is CPU intensive, the UI remains responsive because the calculations run inside the Web Workers.
