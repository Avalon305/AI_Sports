# Camera Advanced Capture sample

Provides an end-to-end sample to show how to write a camera app using the Windows.Media.Capture API in 
conjunction with orientation sensors to cover the functions that most camera apps will require. 
Uses the Windows.Media.Core.SceneAnalysisEffect API to get information about the preview scene and give a 
recommendation on how beneficial an HDR capture would be. Also shows a simple way to use the 
Windows.Media.Capture.AdvancedCapture API, which enables functionality such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) 
and Low Light captures, included in Windows. This sample is based on the [Basic camera app sample](../CameraStarterKit).

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample will cover how to:

1. **Manage the MediaCapture object** throughout the lifecycle of the app and through navigation events.
2. **Acquire a camera located on a specific side of the device**. In this case, the sample attempts to get the rear camera.
3. **Start and stop the preview** to a UI element, including mirroring for front-facing cameras.
4. **Take a regular picture** to a file, taking into account the orientation of the device.
5. **Manage the Scene Analysis effect**, including creation, activation/deactivation of the HighDynamicRangeAnalyzer, registering for the SceneAnalyzed event, and cleanup. The effect is used throughout the lifetime of the app, and the analysis result is shown to the user.
6. **Configure the AdvancedPhotoControl** to capture images, create an instance of the AdvancedCapture, and register for the AllAllPhotosCaptured event, which signals that the camera is ready to capture again, and for the OptionalReferencePhotoCaptured, which will be raised only on devices that support delivering a reference image alongside the processed image, and carries the reference image in the payload.
7. **Take an Advanced Capture picture** to a file, taking into account the orientation of the device. This can be an HDR, a Low Light, or a standard picture, depending on the capabilities of the device.
8. **Handle rotation events** for both, the device moving in space and the page orientation changing on the screen. Also apply any necessary corrections to the preview stream rotation.
9. **Handle MediaCapture Failed event** to clean up the MediaCapture instance when an error occurs.

This sample also implements a custom UI to better simulate the experience that a camera application would provide, so any messages intended for the developer are printed to the debug console.

## System requirements

**Hardware:** Camera

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:** Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

**Deploying the sample:**

1.  Select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**.

**Deploying and running the sample:**

1.  To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
