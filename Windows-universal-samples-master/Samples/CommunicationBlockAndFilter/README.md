# Communication blocking and filtering sample

Shows how to make a block and filter application for call and text message.
Uses the
[CommunicationBlockingAppManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.communicationblocking.communicationblockingappmanager.aspx)
class to set itself as the active communication blocking app and uses the
[PhoneCallBlocking](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.calls.phonecallblocking.aspx) class
to set the phone numbers which are blocked.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample demonstrates how to

- Register background tasks for blocking and filtering calls and text messages.
  - A task which runs when the session starts. The task sets the blocked number list.
  - A task which runs when the app becomes the active communication blocking app. The task sets the blocked number list.
  - A task which runs when a call is blocked.
  - A task which runs when a text message is blocked.
  - A task which runs when a text message is received. The task evaluates the text message and decide whether to block it.
- Determine whether the app is the the active communication blocking app.
- Display the system UI to let the user choose a communication blocking app.
- Set the phone numbers which are blocked.

See the Package.appxmanifest file for the extensions and capabilities
a communication blocking and filtering app must declare.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
