# Radial Controller sample

Shows how to use the RadialController class
to create custom menu items for a Surface Dial device,
control the haptic feedback, and configure the default system items.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Add, remove, and select custom items:** This sample demonstrates how to add, remove, and select custom items dynamically using system-provided icons,
  app-provided bitmaps, glyphs from a system-provided font, or glyphs from an app-provided font.
- **Control haptic feedback:** This sample demonstrates how to enable and disable the haptic feedback for custom items.
- **Configure default system items:** This sample demonstrates how to add, remove, and select the default system items.
- **Suppress the menu:** Normally, the system displays a menu when the user presses the Surface Dial.
  The app can suppress the menu and direct input to a specific controller.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2017 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
