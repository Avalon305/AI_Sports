# UserConsentVerifier sample

Shows how to use the UserConsentVerifier class to check whether a verifier device, such as a Microsoft Passport PIN, Windows Hello, or fingerprint reader, is available.

> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center.
