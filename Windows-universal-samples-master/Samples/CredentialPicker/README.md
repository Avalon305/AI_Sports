# Credential picker sample

Shows how to use the Windows.Security.Credentials.UI.CredentialPicker class to retrieve credentials, 
which can then be passed to APIs that may require credentials (for example, HttpClient). This can be used in support of single sign on (SSO).

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

This sample allows the user launch different types of credential prompts. You can choose one of three scenarios: 
- Message
- Message and Caption
- Message, Caption, Save Credential Option, and a type of protocol.
